Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and shall similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing. Proprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by it independently and without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure. If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement provided that Licensee gives Microchip prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or limit such disclosure, Licensee cooperates with Microchip to protect Proprietary Information, and Licensee complies with any protective order in place and discloses only the information required by process of law.</p>
<p class="p">(b) Licensee agrees that the provisions of this Agreement regarding unauthorized use and
nondisclosure of the Software, Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Microchip and its licensors and that monetary damages alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its licensors if such provisions are violated. Licensee, therefore, agrees that if Microchip alleges that Licensee or Third Party has breached or violated such provision then Microchip will have the right to petition for injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.</p>

<li class="li"><span class="indent-level-default">6.</span><p class="p">Ownership of Proprietary Rights.</p>
<p class="p">(a) Microchip and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software and
Documentation ("Proprietary Rights") including, but not limited to: (i) patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in the Software, Documentation, and underlying technology; (ii) the Software as implemented in any device or system, all hardware and software implementations of the Software technology (expressly excluding Licensee and Third Party code developed and used in conformance with this Agreement solely to interface with the Software and Licensee Products and/or Third Party Products); and (iii) all modifications and derivative works thereof (by whomever produced). Further, modifications and derivative works shall be considered works made for hire with ownership vesting in Microchip on creation. To the extent such modifications and derivatives do not qualify as a "work for hire," Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, assigns and conveys the exclusive copyright thereof to Microchip, free and clear of any and all liens, claims or other encumbrances, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in Section 1 above.</p>
<p class="p">(b) Licensee shall have no right to sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the
Software, Documentation or any related intellectual property rights except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><span class="indent-level-default">7.</span><p class="p">Termination of Agreement. Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement terminates
immediately, without notice by Microchip, upon a failure by License or Third Party to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Further, Microchip may also terminate this Agreement upon reasonable belief that Licensee or Third Party have failed to comply with this Agreement. Upon termination, Licensee and Third Party will immediately stop using the Software, Documentation, and derivatives thereof, and immediately destroy all such copies, remove Software from any of Licensee's tangible media and from systems on which the Software exists, and stop using, disclosing, copying, or reproducing Software (even as may be permitted by this Agreement). Termination of this Agreement will not affect the right of any end user or consumer to use Licensee Products or Third Party Products provided that such products were purchased prior to the termination of this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><span class="indent-level-default">8.</span><p class="p">Dangerous Applications. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or

The aggregate and cumulative liability of Microchip and its licensors for damages hereunder will in no event exceed $1000 or the amount Licensee paid Microchip for the Software and Documentation, whichever is greater. Licensee acknowledges that the foregoing limitations are reasonable and an essential part of this Agreement.</p>

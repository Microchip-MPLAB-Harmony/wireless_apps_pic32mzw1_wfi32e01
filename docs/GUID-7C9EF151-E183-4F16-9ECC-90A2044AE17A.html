Notwithstanding the license grants contained herein, Licensee acknowledges that certain components of the Software may be covered by so-called &#34;open source&#34; software licenses (&#34;Open Source Components&#34;). Open Source Components means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including any license that, as a condition of distribution, requires Microchip to provide Licensee with certain notices and/or information related to such Open Source Components, or requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format. Microchip will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify such Open Source Components in a text file or &#34;About Box&#34; or in a file or files referenced thereby (and will include any associated license agreement, notices, and other related information therein), or the Open Source Components will contain or be accompanied by its own license agreement. To the extent required by the licenses covering Open Source Components, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement, and Microchip hereby represents and warrants that the licenses granted to such Open Source Components will be no less broad than the license granted in Section 1(b). To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Components, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source Components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&#34;- topic/li &#34; xtrf=&#34;file:/D:/InfoShare/Data/Publish/Data/i0ljxc4yqul/work/3/en-US/GUID-7C9EF151-E183-4F16-9ECC-90A2044AE17A.md&#34; xtrc=&#34;li:4;184:15&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;- topic/p &#34; xtrf=&#34;file:/D:/InfoShare/Data/Publish/Data/i0ljxc4yqul/work/3/en-US/GUID-7C9EF151-E183-4F16-9ECC-90A2044AE17A.md&#34; xtrc=&#34;p:15;184:15&#34;&gt;Licensee's Obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;- topic/p &#34; xtrf=&#34;file:/D:/InfoShare/Data/Publish/Data/i0ljxc4yqul/work/3/en-US/GUID-7C9EF151-E183-4F16-9ECC-90A2044AE17A.md&#34; xtrc=&#34;p:16;184:15&#34;&gt;(a) Licensee will ensure Third Party compliance with the terms of this Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;- topic/p &#34; xtrf=&#34;file:/D:/InfoShare/Data/Publish/Data/i0ljxc4yqul/work/3/en-US/GUID-7C9EF151-E183-4F16-9ECC-90A2044AE17A.md&#34; xtrc=&#34;p:17;184:15&#34;&gt;(b) Licensee will not: (i) engage in unauthorized use, modification, disclosure or distribution of Software or Documentation, or its derivatives; (ii) use all or any portion of the Software, Documentation, or its derivatives except in conjunction with Microchip Products; or (iii) reverse engineer (by disassembly, decompilation or otherwise) Software or any portion thereof; or (iv) copy or reproduce all or any portion of Software, except as specifically allowed by this Agreement or expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding the foregoing limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;- topic/p &#34; xtrf=&#34;file:/D:/InfoShare/Data/Publish/Data/i0ljxc4yqul/work/3/en-US/GUID-7C9EF151-E183-4F16-9ECC-90A2044AE17A.md&#34; xtrc=&#34;p:18;184:15&#34;&gt;(c) Licensee must include Microchip's copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices in all copies of the Software, Documentation, and its derivatives.

Notwithstanding the license grants contained herein, Licensee
acknowledges that certain components of the Software may be covered by so-called "open source" software licenses ("Open Source Components"). Open Source Components means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including any license that, as a condition of distribution, requires Microchip to provide Licensee with certain notices and/or information related to such Open Source Components, or requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format. Microchip will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify such Open Source Components in a text file or "About Box" or in a file or files referenced thereby (and will include any associated license agreement, notices, and other related information therein), or the Open Source Components will contain or be accompanied by its own license agreement. To the extent required by the licenses covering Open Source Components, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement, and Microchip hereby represents and warrants that the licenses granted to such Open Source Components will be no less broad than the license granted in Section 1(b).

Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and shall similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing. Proprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by it independently and without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure. If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement provided that Licensee gives Microchip prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or limit such disclosure, Licensee cooperates with Microchip to protect Proprietary Information, and Licensee complies with any protective order in place and discloses only the information required by process of law.</p><p class="- topic/p p">(b) Licensee agrees that the provisions of this Agreement regarding unauthorized use and
nondisclosure of the Software, Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Microchip and its licensors and that monetary damages alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its licensors if such provisions are violated. Licensee, therefore, agrees that if Microchip alleges that Licensee or Third Party has breached or violated such provision then Microchip will have the right to petition for injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.</p></li><li class="- topic/li li"><p class="- topic/p p">Ownership of Proprietary Rights.</p><p class="- topic/p p">(a) Microchip and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software and

Further, modifications and derivative works shall be considered works made for hire with ownership vesting in Microchip on creation. To the extent such modifications and derivatives do not qualify as a "work for hire," Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, assigns and conveys the exclusive copyright thereof to Microchip, free and clear of any and all liens, claims or other encumbrances, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in Section 1 above.</p><p class="- topic/p p">(b) Licensee shall have no right to sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the

immediately, without notice by Microchip, upon a failure by License or Third Party to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Further, Microchip may also terminate this Agreement upon reasonable belief that Licensee or Third Party have failed to comply with this Agreement. Upon termination, Licensee and Third Party will immediately stop using the Software, Documentation, and derivatives thereof, and immediately destroy all such copies, remove Software from any of Licensee's tangible media and from systems on which the Software exists, and stop using, disclosing, copying, or reproducing Software (even as may be permitted by this Agreement). Termination of this Agreement will not affect the right of any end user or consumer to use Licensee Products or Third Party Products provided that such products were purchased prior to the termination of this Agreement.</p></li><li class="- topic/li li"><p class="- topic/p p">Dangerous Applications. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or

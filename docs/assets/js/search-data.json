To the extent such modifications and derivatives do not qualify as a “work for hire,” Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, assigns and conveys the exclusive copyright thereof to Microchip, free and clear of any and all liens, claims or other encumbrances, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in Section 1 above. (b) Licensee shall have no right to sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the Software, Documentation or any related intellectual property rights except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. | Termination of Agreement.

    "content": "Over the Air (OTA) firmware upgrade feature is designed with a two step process, Image Downloading and Image Programming process. Image Downloading process is now processed by the main application firmware. Abstraction model: . | Application is responsible to start the OTA process by calling OTA_start() function to download the new image into the Image Store in the external flash (sst26vf). | Image downloading is done through HTTP protocol. | Bootloader is responsible for the programming process, which loads and copies the best image from Image Store to Program area and jumps to the Application. The bootloader also supports ‘Fail-Safe’ boot scheme which the firmware automatically rolls back if the image has not been run correctly at the previous boot. | Image-Store in external flash (sst26vf) can have multiple images, including the default image for factory reset. | . Application Image Structure : . OTA application image structure is organised as shown in below picture. Total application length includes header bytes as well. Bootloader copies Application Image Length bytes from Image-Store to Program-flash area. Application Header Structure : . Every ota image includes a header to keep track of image status as shown in below table: . OTA application and bootloader maintains IMAGE_HEADER_SIGNATURE byte, which is of one byte, located at 4096th byte (the last byte on the sector, refer Application Image Structure above) on the image header. The value should contain the same with the status field on the top. This is to ensure sector image integrity. If values are different, it is suspected the power cut or unknown reboot happened during the sector programming and image in that particular slot is treated as invalid image. | order - it will be incremented for every image downloaded using OTA. If this value reaches 15 and then OTA process downloads a new image , value will 1. | slot - it will indicate the slot in the external flash where the image is located. | 0 for defual image | 1 for slot 1 | 2 for slot 2 | . | . OTA application follows below steps while downloading an image from HTTP server: . | Allocating slot: When OTA process is initiated, the OTA framework will try to allocate a slot for the new image in the external flash. This slot will either be a blank slot, the lowest ranked or invalidated application firmware image slot. The External flash will be configured for 3 slots for, storing upto 3 OTA images. Slot 0 is reserved for the factory image and can not be replaced with an image obtained through OTA process. Only slot 1 and slot 2 will be used for storing new OTA images. Application allocates the slots in sequential order, meaning ota image downloaded during first OTA process will be stored in slot1 and 2nd OTA image downloaded during 2nd OTA process will be stored in the slot2. If the highest slot (slot 2) is already filled with the latest OTA image and user initiates OTA in this situation again, then the slot1 will be allocated for the new OTA image. | The transport layer (HTTP protocol) starts downloading the image. | OTA framework verifies the image by checking the signature field once transport layer finished receiving all data. Signature is a SHA-256 hash. If the downloaded image is valid, the OTA framework updates “Boot-Control”-header, status field of the current application to “Disabled” 0xF0. | The application will be notified about OTA process completion using user registered call-back function. If OTA download has successfully finished, the application must reset the system to start the programming process. | . Flow Chart Of The Application: . ",

During boot-up, bootloader will check if any new valid image available in the external flash. If available, it chooses the newly (latest downloaded) available image in the External flash (sst26vf) and program it to Program-Flash area of the device. Bootloader uses SPI protocol to program the image from the external flash. If there is no new downloaded image present in the external flash, bootloader will handover the control to current application present in the program-flash area and application will start executing. The External flash will be configured for 3 slots for storing upto 3 OTA images. Each slot is of size 832KB. Each OTA image will also include header to maintain the image status and SHA-256 Digest signature. Bootloader is having the logic to choose the best suitable valid image, based on the header status of the images and program it to the device. ",

The bootloader also supports ‘Fail-Safe’ boot scheme which the firmware automatically rolls back if the image has not been run correctly at the previous boot. | Image-Store can have multiple images, including the default image for factory reset. | . | During each system boot-up, bootloader checks if it needs to program any image from the external flash. Bootloader goes to program mode, if- . a) any newly downloaded image present in the external flash, . b) if the already present image in the program flash is identified as “not safe” during previous boot. There are two conditions : . | whether the Application Image in Program-Flash area is valid (indicated by the STATUS field, value of 0xF8 in image Header), and | whether it has been confirmed that no errors were present during the previous boot (indicated by the STATUS field (of image Header) value of 0xF8 in the original image located in the external flash). | . According to bootloader logic if these two conditions are satisfied it will not go to “Program Mode” and the bootloader immediately jumps to the application image present in the program-flash area of the device. | If two conditions mentioned in the step 2 are not satisfied, the Bootloader switches to Image Program Mode. In Image Program Mode bootloader follows Image Programming sequence, which finds the highest ranked image in Image-Store(external flash), erases the Program-Flash area and copies the selected image to the Program-Flash area if the image is successfully verified. As the newly downloaded image is set as the highest rank, during the first boot time after the Image-downloading, the Bootloader attempts to load the newly downloaded image at the first try. Bootloader choses the highest ranked image to boot. The images are ranked in following order: . | The latest downloaded Image . | The next booted image . | The next known booted image . | Default (Golden) image . | . | If the image is not valid, the bootloader invalidates the image by setting “Invalidate” 0xF0 in STATUS field of header present in the external flash and restarts the Image-Programming sequence. | If image is verfied successfully, Bootloader updates STATUS field of the image header in external flash- . a) checks the header-status field, if it is “Downloaded” (0xFE) updates it as “Unbooted”(0xFC) and jumps to application image. b) if already a validated image (header-status value is “0xF8”), it starts running application image ignoring above mentioned step a). | Header structure : . | Flow chart : . | .

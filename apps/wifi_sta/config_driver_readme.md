# WLAN STA

This example application shows how to use the PIC32MZW1 WLAN APIs to configure the device in STA mode directly using the WLAN driver APIs.

## Description

In this application, an analog input is converted by a hardware trigger generated by the TMR peripheral. Result is read in the conversion complete interrupt handler. Converted digital value is displayed on the serial terminal.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32mzw1_wfi32e01) and click

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/wifi_sta/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

## Configuring the Application

#### Setting up a regulatory region

The available regulatory domains are  - GEN, USA, EMEA, CUST1 and CUST2. One of these regulatory domains must be selected as an active domain. This selection can be done in two ways.

#### Using MHC

 Figure below shows how to set the regulatory domain in MHC and the path is: TCPIP & SYS_CONSOLE -> TCP/IP STACK -> BASIC CONFIGURATION -> PIC32MZW1

#### Using command

**wlan set regdomain \<reg_domain_name>** is the command used to set the regulatory domain. (wlan set regdomain USA – sets the regulatory domain to USA).


## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| pic32mz_w1_curiosity_driver.X | PIC32MZ W1 Curiosity Board |
|

### Setting up PIC32MZ W1 Curiosity Board

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- On the GPIO Header (J207), connect U1RX (PIN 13) and U1TX (PIN 23) to TX and RX pin of any USB to UART converter like [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) respectively

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 230400
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console displays the initialization messages and WLAN config if already saved in NVM

## Supported Commands

| Command      | Description |
| -------------| ------------|
| wlan set config \<ssid> \<ssid_length> \<channel> \<open/wpa2/wpam/wpa3/wep> \<password> | Configures the SSID, SSID length, channel number and the security of the AP that DUT wants to connect. NOTE: Valid channel numbers are in range 1-13 or 0 to scan all channels wlan connect	Connects the device to the AP that is configured in the command “wlan set” | 
|wlan connect |	Connects the device to the AP that is configured in the command “wlan set” |
| wlan scan \<active / passive> \<channel> \<scan time in ms> | Rus either a active or passive (as per the input) scan on the channel number specified for the time issued in ms. |
|wlan rssi | Gets the RSSI of current association |
| wlan config save |	Saves the parameters issued in command “wlan set” to flash memory. On restart an attempt is made to establish a connection to the credentials saved in flash memory. |
| wlan set regdomain <reg_domain_name>| Sets the regulatory domain |
| wlan get regdomain \<all / current> | Displays the regulatory domain all – request all regulatory domains; current - request current regulatory domain
